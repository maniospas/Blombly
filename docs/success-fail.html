<h1>Success-error handling</h1>

<p>This is a mechanism that consists of two parts. First is a <i>try</i>
statement, which is applied on a block of code to obtain the outcome
of any internal <i>return</i> or <i>fail</i> signals; these are otherwise
ways of escaping calling methods by immediately returning values or
creating errors, but <i>try</i> ensures that any such signals are intercepted.
Its outcome is the intercepted signal and can be assigned to a variable for
further handling, like so:
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">result = try {
    x = x+1;  // invalid code that creates an error (missing variable x)
}
print(result); 
print("Successfully intercepted the above error");
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly to other control flow statements, brackets
are optional for a <i>try</i> that is applied to only one statement.
For example, this can be used to create syntactic variation of
other control flow statements to effectively let them compute
values, break loops, or detect if loops where not broken. As a 
simple example, here is an one-liner that computes the sign 
of a variable <i>x</i>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">sgn = try if(x>=0) return 1 else return -1;
</code></pre>

<p>You will typically want to differentiate between those <i>try</i> results
that hold errors and those that do not. This is achieved through the <i>catch</i>
statement; this is near-identical to a conditional statement with the only difference 
being that it checks whether condition is an error (instead of checking a boolean value). 
An example usage of this statement  is demonstrated in the example below. In this, the
<i>try</i> statement is responsible for intercepting the returned value of <i>i</i>,
which stops the loop immediately.
If no value was returned, <i>try</i> assigns an error value to the result. 
</p>
<p>
The code
then uses <i>catch</i> to handle error scenarios, where the 
<i>fail</i> statement creates an improved description for the error signal. 
If another type of value was encountered (anything other than an error) the
<i>catch</i> clause is ommited and code ontinues per normal.
Notice that there can be more code between trying some code and catching 
its resulting errors. To prevent code smells, 
dangling errors that are never caught create errors when their scope ends.
This means that you can safely use try an interceptor for <i>return</i>
values without worrying about catch clauses unrelated to this functionality.</p> 

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">least = 4;
i = 0;
result = try while (i&lt;=100) {
    i = i + 3;
    if (i&gt;=least) 
        return i;
}
print("Finished searching.");
catch (result) 
    fail("Found nothing: "+str(result));
print("The least multiple of 3 in range ["+str(least)+", 100] is: "+str(result));
</code></pre>
