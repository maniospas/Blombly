<h1>Preprocess (include, macro)</h1>

<p>Blombly's preprocessor can understand several instructions that transform the source code before compilation into <i>.bbvm</i> files.
Three transformations are available: dependencies that make a source code file include another's codes, macros that add to the language's
grammar with higher-level expressions, and specification property declarations. Of those, specifications are already 
described in <a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">section 2.3</a> as a mechanism that attaches final values on code blocks
by evaluating them just after the block's definition.</p>

<h2>3.1.a Include and modules</h2>

<p>
Dependencies on other <code>.bb</code> files are stated with a pattern like so:
<code class="language-java">#include "std/oop"</code>. 
This stratement inlines the contents of the file <i>std/oop.bb</i>.
Dependencies allow code modularization without loading overheads, as the compiled <code>.bbvm</code> 
packs all necessary instructions to run directly. Note that dependencies should not declare 
specifications, as these are the provenance of code blocks meant to run dynamically instead of
immediately upon import. When creating reusable libraries, prefer constructing modules final objects
(this is automated with <code>module</code> keyword of <code>std/oop</code>).
Conversely, specifications are easy to create for the main files as top-level imports.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of what a module may look like. Instead of specifications, final properties
are set for documentation and versioning. However, methods (which are essentially code blocks
meant to be called) obtain specifications. Notice that those specifications can depend on
the library's other properties. After the library's definition this can be imported and its
methods called. As an example, we inline the library object, which transfers all
its variables to the local context. As a sidenote, there is no consumption of test outcomes
(e.g., no check on whether they create errors) which means that successful testing
is verified in parallel to other computations.
</p>

<i>mylib.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">#include "std/oop"  // for the module and fn macros (more later)

module mylib {
    final name = "mylib";
    final author = "Emmanouil Krasanakis";
    final doc = "This is a simple numeric interface";
    final version = 1.0;

    fn add(x, y) {
        #spec doc = "Computes an addition in "+name;
        #spec version = version;
        return x + y;
    }
    fn abs(x) {
        #spec doc = "Computes the absolute value in "+name;
        #spec version = version;
        if(x&lt;0)
            return 0-x;
        return x;
    }
    final tests = {
        if(add(1,2)!=3)
            fail("Invalid addition");
        if(abs(0-1)!=1)
            fail("Invalid abs");
        print("Tests successful.");
    }
}</code></pre>



<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">#include "mylib"

mylib.tests();
mylib:

print(add.doc);
print(add(1,2));
</code></pre>


<h2>3.1.b Macros</h2>

<p>Macros are transformations for reducing boilerplate code. They are declared with statements of the form
<code>#macro (@expression)=(@transformation);</code>. In these,
both the expression and transformation parts consist of fixed "keyword" tokens and named wildcard tokens, prepended with <code>@</code>. 
Wildcards represent any sequence of tokens and matched between the expression and the transformation. To support
faster compilation and improve comprehension, the first token of the expression needs to be a keyword (for example, <code>@name fn @args</code>
is not a valid expression, but <code>fn @name (@args)</code> is valid).
Three example follow, which are simplified versions of the <code>std/oop</code> module:</p>

<i>std/oop.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">// this is a simplified version of the actual module
#macro (class @name {@code}) = (final @name = {@code});
#macro (fn @name(@args){@code}) = (final @name(@args) = {@code});
#macro (module @name {@code}) = (final @name = new {@code});</code></pre>

<ul>
    <li>The first macro defines a class. The <code>@name</code> placeholder is replaced by the class name, and <code>{@code}</code> is replaced by the class body.</li>
    <li>The second macro defines a function. The <code>@name</code> placeholder is replaced by the function name, <code>@args</code> by the function arguments, and <code>{@code}</code> by the function body.</li>
    <li>The third macroo defines a module. The <code>@name</code> placeholder is replaced by the module name, and <code>{@code}</code> by the module content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of how these macros can be used in a Blombly program.
This defineds a <i>Finder</i> class using the <code>class</code> macro and two functions <code>contains</code> and <code>next</code> using the <code>fn</code> macro. 
The <code>Finder</code> class contains methods to check if a number is prime and to find the next prime number. The instance of <code>Finder</code> is created with an initial number of 10, 
and the <code>next</code> function is called twice to find the next prime numbers.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">#include "std/oop"  // include the file declaring the macros

class Finder { 
    fn contains(number) {
        i = 2;
        i_max = int(number^0.5);
        while (i &lt;= i_max) {
            if (number % i == 0) 
                return false;
            i = i + 1;
        }
        return true;
    }

    fn next() {
        while (true) {
            this.number = this.number + 1;
            if (this.contains(number)) 
                return this.number;
        }
    }
}

finder = new {Finder:number = 10;}

print(next(finder));
print(next(finder));</code></pre>
