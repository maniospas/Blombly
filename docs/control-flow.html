<h1>Control Flow</h1>

<p>Control flow expressions alter which code segments are executed next.
Blombly offers similar options to most programming languages in terms of
condititional branching, loops, and method calling. The first two are descibed
in this section, whereas method calling in <a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.4</a>. 
However, the language also provides more dynamic options, namely the ability to 
"paste" code by diretly inlining it, which we introduce in
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">next section</a>,
and success-error handling that intercepts return values, which is detailed in
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 3.2</a>. Intercepting
success values can also create advanced versions of conditional branching and loops,
and some patterns are described in this section for completeness.
</p>

<h3>2.2.a Conditions</h3>
<p>
Conditional statements take the form <code>if(@expression){@accept}else{@reject}</code>
where <code>@</code> reflects code This symbol complies with how macros discussed in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="preprocessor.html">section 3.1</a> would go about defining the 
pattern of the condition statement.
The expression is evaluated within the current context
and the accepted code runs (still in the context) in the context if the outcome is <code>true</code>.
The <code>else</code> branch is optional; its reject code is executed if the
expression evaluates to <code>false</code>. 
If any branch's code comprise only one statement, you may ignore the brackets. 
In this case, a semicolon must be placed only at the end
of the statement to separate it from the rest of code. If you accidentally
put a semicolon before an <code>else</code>, the compiler will
 also
create an error message to explain this. For example, 
the following code has valid syntax for both the first branch to print
"positive" and the the nested condition lets us create an <code>else if</code> clause.
Given the option, avoid this type of nesting for fast execution, 
and rely on the <code>try</code> statement described
 later in this section.
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">x = 1;
if (x&gt;0) 
    print("positive")
else if(x&lt;0)
    print("negative");
</code></pre>

<h3>2.2.b Loops and iterators</h3>

<p>Loops take the form <code>while (expression) {
@code}</code> and continuously executes a code block as long 
as the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>.
The expression is re-evaluated at each repetition,
and the loop may run indefinitely if the condition never becomes
false. To avoid unambiguousness, there are <i>no other</i> ways in the 
main blombly language to declare a loop. 
(Keep in mind, though, that one can write macros to express more loops.)
Here is an example where loop runs as long as the condition <i>counter &lt; 10</i> 
holds <i>true</i>. During each iteration, the loop prints the current value of the
<i>counter</i> and increments it by 1. Once that value becomes 10, 
the condition evaluates to <i>false</i>, and the loop terminates.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
while (counter&lt;10) {
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
}</code></pre>

<p>A common task when writting code is to traverse all the elements
in a list or vector. To do this efficiently, blombly employs an
iteration mechanism that, after created, can be
travered using the <code>next</code> method. 
This mechanism is applied on all objects that overload the length
method, as well as item getters and setters. The next example
shows how to define an iterator from a list and use it to traverse all
of its elements. The loop uses the <code>as</code> assignment
(instead of <code>=</code>) to identify if a next element actually
existed. This type of assignment was covered in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="vars-operations-comments.html">section 2.1</a>,
so you might want to revisit it for a refresher. Briefly,
the loop condition performs an assignment to <code>i</code> 
while evaluating to whether that assignment successfully created a new
variable value.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">l = 1,2,3,4,5;
it = iter(l);
sum = 0;
while(i as next(it)) 
	sum = sum+i;
print(sum);</code></pre>





<h3>2.2.c Introduction to signals</h3>
<p>
Blombly does not implement break and continue keywords,
because these can be substituted by a mixture of the <i>try</i> and <i>return</i> 
statements. The latter create a type of signal interception pattern of those
detailed in <a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 3.2</a>;
here, we get a first taste. The first is broadly responsible for
intercepting any returning (or error) values so that they can be assigned 
to variables, whereas the second for stopping code execution with a returning 
value. The usage associated with code execution is to use <i>try</i>
before control flow statements so as to assign their returning outcome.
As a simple example, here is an one-liner that computes the sign 
of a variable <i>x</i>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">sgn = try if(x>=0) return 1 else return -1;
</code></pre>

<p>
Use a similar syntax to break from loops, though handling missing
return values will not be described for now. What should be mentioned
is that, constrary to errors, intercepting returning values is lightweight.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
try while (true) {
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
    if(counter==10)
        return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Finally, prepend <i>try</i> to the loop body's opening
bracket to intercept return
values there. Notice that this syntax only allows one
among breaking, continuing, or triggering an unconstrained
return (e.g., that would return from a method) 
in the same loop. This helps write simple
code that is easy to understand by bringing only one
modification to each loop.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
while (counter&lt;10) try {
    if (counter % 2==0)
        return;
    print("Odd value: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
}
</code></pre>
