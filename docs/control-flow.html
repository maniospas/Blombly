<h1>Control Flow</h1>

<p>Control flow expressions alter which code segments are executed next.
Blombly offers similar options to most programming languages in terms of
condititional branching, loops, and method calling. The first two are descibed
in this section, whereas method calling in <a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.4</a>. 
However, the language also provides more dynamic options, namely the ability to 
"paste" code by diretly inlining it, which we introduce in
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">next section</a>,
and success-error handling that intercepts return values, which is detailed in
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.6</a>. Intercepting
success values can also create advanced versions of conditional branching and loops,
and some patterns are described in this section for completeness.
</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>
The <i>if</i> and <i>while</i> statements implement conditional branching 
and loops respectively. Of these, 
conditional statements evaluate expressions within the current context
and execute the associated code block if the outcome is <i>true</i>.
There may also be an optional <i>else</i> branch that is executed if the
expression evaluates to <i>false</i>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression) {
    // code to be executed if expression is true
}
else {
    // code to be executed if expression is false
}
</code></pre>

<p>If code blocks comprise only one statement, you may replace brackets with 
that statement. In this case, a semicolon must be placed only at the end
of the condition to separate it from the rest of code. If you accidentally
pout a semicolon before an <i>else</i> statement, the compiler will
create an error message for you. For example, 
the following code has valid syntax for both the first branch to print
"positive" and the the nested condition that creates an <i>else if</i> clause.
Given the option, avoid this type of nesting conditions, as they may
create memory bloat. Instead, rely on <i>try</i> statements described
below.
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">x = 1;
if (x&gt;0) 
    print("positive")
else if(x&lt;0)
    print("negative");
</code></pre>

<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>The <i>while</i> statement continuously executes a code block as long 
as the expression evaluates to <i>true</i>,
where the expression is re-evaluated at each repetition. 
This creates a loop that can run indefinitely if the condition never becomes
false. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">while (expression) {
    // code to be executed as long as expression is true
}</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example where loop runs as long as the condition <i>counter &lt; 10</i> 
holds <i>true</i>. During each iteration, the loop prints the current value of the
<i>counter</i> and increments it by 1. Once that value becomes 10, 
the condition evaluates to <i>false</i>, and the loop terminates.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
while (counter&lt;10) {
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
}</code></pre>

<h3>Introduction to signal interception</h3>
<p>
Blombly does not implement break and continue keywords,
because these can be substituted by a mixture of the <i>try</i> and <i>return</i> 
statements. The latter create a type of signal interception pattern of those
detailed in <a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.6</a>;
here, we get a first taste. The first is broadly responsible for
intercepting any returning (or error) values so that they can be assigned 
to variables, whereas the second for stopping code execution with a returning 
value. The usage associated with code execution is to use <i>try</i>
before control flow statements so as to assign their returning outcome.
As a simple example, here is an one-liner that computes the sign 
of a variable <i>x</i>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">sgn = try if(x>=0) return 1 else return -1;
</code></pre>

<p>
Use a similar syntax to break from loops, though handling missing
return values will not be described for now. What should be mentioned
is that, constrary to errors, intercepting returning values is lightweight.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
try while (true) {
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
    if(counter==10)
        return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Finally, prepend <i>try</i> to the loop body's opening
bracket to intercept return
values there. Notice that this syntax only allows one
among breaking, continuing, or triggering an unconstrained
return (e.g., that would return from a method) 
in the same loop. This helps write simple
code that is easy to understand by bringing only one
modification to each loop.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">counter = 0;
while (counter&lt;10) try {
    if (counter % 2==0)
        return;
    print("Odd value: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
}
</code></pre>
