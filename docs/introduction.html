<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
There are many programming languages for writing dynamic yet safe code. You might 
already have a favorite one! However, safety often comes at the cost of reduced 
expressiveness, like mutability restrictions or relies on
non-infallible programers. Blombly is a language that aims to address these
issues with a small base instruction set that is easy to learn
but promises code and memory safety by design. It also focuses on algorithmic logic 
by automating tasks like memory management and parallelization without losing
expressiveness. All its interfaces further follow an "one solution" principle,
meaning that there should be one obvious way to implement code in most situations. For example,
there is only one loop structure (<code>while</code>) and alternatives
like iterating over all list elements are implemented as macros that use it.</p>
<p>
Blombly compiles into an intermediate representation that is interpreted by 
the <i><strong>BLO</strong>ck ase<strong>MBLY</strong> <strong>V</strong>irtual 
<strong>M</strong>achine</i> (blomblyVM). The latter
ensures reliability by replacing jump-based statements to entering and exiting
code blocks. This includes managing control flow via conditions, loops, inlining,
method calling, return statements for successful operations, and error messages for failures.

<p>
So, who is Blombly for? It might be a good choice if you want to:<br>
</p>
✅ Quickly learn a dynamic scripting language.<br>
✅ Write sequential code that runs in parallel.<br>
✅ Ensure memory and logic safety by design.<br>
