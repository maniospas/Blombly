<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
There are a lot of programming languages to write dynamic yet safe code. 
Maybe you already have a favorite one! However, safety often comes at the 
expense of complexity, such as modifications to pure algorithmic logic
that worry about non-functional code characteristics.
Programmers then need to worry about concepts like borrow checkers, 
deadlocks, and race conditions.
</p>
<p>
Blombly is a language with small instruction set and algorithm-only semantics: it is limited to a few operations that cover a
broad range of scenarios. Non-algorithmic tasks like memory management and parallelization 
are automated under-the-hood, and the syntax operates under an "one solution" principle; if there is an obvious way
to do something, there is likely no other obvious way to do it. 
The main language is compiled into an intermediate respresentation 
and is interpreted by an accompanying 
<i><strong>BLO</strong>ck ase<strong>MBLY</strong> <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>M</strong>achine</i> 
(blomblyVM). The latter parses block-based assembly instructions that ensure reliability through
the absense of jump statements; flow constrol is performed through code blocks of asembly instructions 
that are easier to apply safety constraints on. There are exactly two mechanisms that interupt this 
control flow: return statements for successful algorithms, and error messages for intermediate logic failures.
</p>
<p>
So, who is blombly for? It may be a nice tool if your aim is one of the following:<br><br>

✅ Quickly learn a dynamic (duck-typed) scripting language.<br>
✅ Write sequential code that runs in parallel.<br>
✅ Ensure memory and logic safety by design.<br>
</p>


<h3>A short demo</h3>
<p>
Below is a small blombly program that showcases several base language features.
Practical code can be a bit more explicit by including modules that declare
additional functions and helper methods.
For example, the "oop" library lets callable methods 
be declared with the pattern <code>fn @method(@args){@code}</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">final scaler = {  // declares a code block, final variables are visible outside their scope
    default scale = 1;
    if(scale&lt;=0)
       error("Scale should be greater than zero, but another value was given: "+str(scale));
}

final add(x,y) = {
    signal = try{scaler:} // `:` performs inline execution
    catch(signal) {
        print("handled an error");
        return 0;
    }
    return (x + y)*scale;
}

result = add(1, 2 | scale=0);  // calls may be executed in parallel
print(result);
</code></pre>

<p>
    The program starts with a code block that creates a <code>scale</code> variable with a provided default,
    if it does not already exist (we will see momentarily how it might exist). Then, the code block
    creates an error message if a non-positive scale is provided. The code block declaration does not run any code, 
    but only creates a variable holding the block for future use. It is made <code>final</code> so that it 
    cannot be modified. Similarly, a code block that performs addition and multiplication with some scale is provided.
    This takes as input two positional arguments <code>x,y</code>.
    This block also uses the <code>scaler:</code> symbol to inline the namesake. Inlining constitutes of 
    immediately calling the other block's code, as if it were pasted already.
</p>
    
    <p>
    Inlining is further enriched by enclosing it an a <code>try</code> statement (the brackets can be inferred
    by the language, but they are there for clarity). This statement is responsible for intercepting errors and inline return
    values, and then places the intercepted values in the variable <code>signal</code>. The <code>catch</code>
    catch mechanism is the equivalent of <code>if</code>, with the difference that it is entered if it encounters an error
    instead of boolean truth. For safety, unhandled error values create further errors if they are never handled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Finally, the code block is called like a function with positional arguments. There are also
    statements that create more variables after a <code>|</code> separator. These
    look like positional variables (separated by semicolons if there are multiple), 
    but offer greater flexibility.
    For example, they can inline the same code block parameters across several methods. Variables created after 
    <code>|</code> are transferred to the called <code>add</code> block together with positional arguments.
    Called blocks are automatically scheduled for parallel execution.
    While running, they have access only to transferred values and <code>final</code> variables.
