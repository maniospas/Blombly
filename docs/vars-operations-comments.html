<h1>Vars, operations, comments</h1>

<p>Blombly only has line comments that start with <code>//</code>. 
However, it supports multi-line strings (the str type), and thus
can create documentation for code blocks by creating 
metadata properties in the way described in the 
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">next section</a>. Below is a first take of 
what this looks like in your programs. The <code>#</code> symbol at the beginning shows
that <i>doc</i> is not a variable but a metadata property to be assigned to the code block.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">//Each file is considered a code block
#doc = "Here is multiline documentation
 that describes the current code block.";
print("Hellow world!");
</code></pre>

<p>Assign values to variables with the <code>=</code>operator, like below. If a variable 
with the same name already exists in the current scope, its value is overwritten.
Otherwise, a new variable is created. Subsequent code in the same scope will 
retrieve thet assigned value when using the variable. From this description,
we also get a first intuition of what scopes are: they refer to isolated
execution contexts in which subsequent code can overwrite variable values. Each program
starts from one initial scope, but new ones are created when calling code blocks, for
example with the code patterns described in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.3</a>. For the time being,
all our code remains in the same scope.</p>


<p>There are several builtin data types that are directly created by the compiler.
These are int, float, bool, str, code. Although variables can switch type when assigning 
to, code that retains the same builtin type for each variable 
(which is a typical coding pattern) executes faster. Here is an example with the first 
four builtin types - the last one will be covered in the 
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">next section</a>.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">i = 1;     // int
f = 1.2;   // float
b = false; // bool
s = "this is a string literal";</code></pre>

<p>The numeric types int and float accept the arithmetics <code>+-*/</code> that are common
across most programming languages, where division always yields a float. The
exponent <code>^</code> is defined for both numeric types, and the modulo <code>%</code>
is defined between ints. Also similarly to most languages, and inequalities with bool
outcomes <code>&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</code> are provided. 
Furthermore <code>== !=</code> can compare any types for equality and inequality respectively.
Operations between bools are <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>. Finally, str can be
concatenated with <code>+</code>. Convert between types with their names like so:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">x = int("1");
y = float("0.5");
print("Sum is "+str(x+y));</code></pre>

<p>Running this creates the following output in the console:</p>

<pre class="code-output">> blombly main.bb
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
Result is 1.500000
</pre>

<p>Lastly, variables can be made immutable by prepending the <i>final</i> keyword
to the assignment. This prevents any overwriting of their value and exposes them outside
the current scope, for example in dependent code blocks calls later. Here is an example
where there is an attempt to overwrite a final variable, which is invalid syntax.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">final x = 0;
x = x+1;  // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>

<p>When running the above, the code safety of the final keyword lets us create an error
message:</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>) Cannot overwrite final value: x
  <span class="arrow">â†’</span> add x x _bb2                                main.bbvm line 4
