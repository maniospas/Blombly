<h1>Vars, operations, comments</h1>

<p>This section covers blombly's most basic commands.
These are comments, which include a first taste of metadata, variables, and builtin
 operations. A separate subsection is also dedicated to the <code>list</code> 
and <code>vector</code> types, for which several operations are defined. 
In addition to familiar concepts, there is a first introduction to metadata attributes,
as well as final (immutable) assignments and missing value handling. 
To acclimate to unfamiliar concepts, the reader 
is  encouraged to skim through this section.</p>

<h2>2.1.a Comments</h2>

<p>Blombly only has line comments that start with <code>//</code>. 
However, it supports multi-line strings (the str type). In addition
to code block specificiation properties, detailed 
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">section 2.3</a>,
multiline strings can be used to create detailed specifications. Below is a first take of 
what this looks like in your programs. The <code>#</code> symbol at the beginning 
signifies an instruction to the compiler's preprocessor, which makes the necessary
transformations to convert this to less readable but valid code. The prefix
<code>#spec</code> indicates that this is a specification to be assigned to the code block.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">//Each file is considered a code block
#spec doc = "Here is multiline documentation
 that describes the current code block.";
print("Hellow world!");
</code></pre>

<h2>2.1.b Basic values</h2>

<p>Assign values to variables with the <code>=</code>operator, like below. If a variable 
with the same name already exists in the current scope, its value is overwritten.
Otherwise, a new variable is created. Subsequent code in the same scope will 
retrieve thet assigned value when using the variable. From this description,
we also get a first intuition of what scopes are: they refer to isolated
execution contexts in which subsequent code can overwrite variable values. Each program
starts from one initial scope, but new ones are created when calling code blocks, for
example with the code patterns described in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">section 2.3</a>. For the time being,
all our code remains in the same scope.</p>


<p>There are several builtin data types that are directly created by the compiler.
These are int, float, bool, str, code. Although variables change types to mirror
the value they have been assigned, code that retains the same builtin type for each variable 
(which is a typical coding pattern) executes faster. Here is an example with the first 
four builtin types - the last one will be covered in the 
<a rel="prefetch" href="code-blocks-inline.html">section 2.3</a>.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">i = 1;     // int
f = 1.2;   // float
b = false; // bool
s = "this is a string literal";</code></pre>

<p>The numeric types int and float accept the arithmetics <code>+-*/</code> that are common
across most programming languages, where division always yields a float. The
exponent <code>^</code> is defined for both numeric types, and the modulo <code>%</code>
is defined between ints. Also similarly to most languages, and inequalities with bool
outcomes <code>&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</code> are provided. 
Furthermore <code>== !=</code> can compare any types for equality and inequality respectively.
Operations between bools are <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>. Finally, str can be
concatenated with <code>+</code>. Convert between types with their names like so:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">x = int("1");
y = float("0.5");
print("Sum is "+str(x+y));</code></pre>

<p>Running this creates the following output in the console:</p>

<pre class="code-output">> blombly main.bb
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
Result is 1.500000
</pre>


<h2>2.1.c Final and missing values</h2>

<p>Variables can be made immutable by prepending the <code>final</code> keyword
to their assignment. This prevents any other code from overwriting their value.
With this safety measure in place, final variables are also exposed
exposed outside the current scope, for example in dependent code blocks calls later. 
Here is an example where there is an attempt to overwrite a final variable but fails.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">final x = 0;
x = x+1;  // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>

<p>When running the above, the code safety of the final keyword kicks in and creates an error
message:</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>) Cannot overwrite final value: x
  <span class="arrow">→</span> add x x _bb2                                main.bbvm line 4
</pre>

<p>Some operations, such as an iterator's next element and valueless return statements, 
may enerate missing values. Think of those as similar to null pointers, but with a
stark difference: when assigned to variables, they completely remove the latter from the 
scope. Missing values are different than error mechanisms in that they represent
failures that are expected or even desireable.</p>

<p>
Importantly, missing values cannot be transferred, as this creates a missing
variable error. Thus, they cannot
silently infest the code during execution. They can also be handled with the <code>as</code>
assignment demonstrated below, which yields a boolean value indicating the absense 
of missing values. An <code>as</code>-based assignment can only set scope variables, and not, say
struct fields or list elements.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">l = list();
had_next = x as next(l);
print(had_next);  // false (means that x is a missing variable)
</code></pre>


<h2>2.1.d Lists and vectors</h2>
<p>
Lists can be declared by separating several values of potential different types
with commas <code>,</code>. List elements correspond to unique indexes, 
where <code>0</code> is the index of the first element. You can use square brackets
to access and set list elements based on their indexes. This is demonstrated 
in the following example.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">l = 0, 1, "b";
l[1] = "a";
print(l);
</code></pre>

<p>Create a list of one or zero elements with the <code>list()</code>
method. Lists increase in size when
setting values to indexes greater of their current length (negative
indexes still create an error though). This does allocate memory,
but reading from non-existing indices creates missing variable errors.
Elements can also be added with the <code>push</code> method, which takes
as arguments a list and the value to add to its end. 
To remove list elements, the <code>next</code> and <code>pop</code>
methods remove and return the first element and last element respectively. 
Here is an example demonstrating these concepts:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">l = list();
push(l, 0);
push(l, 1);
print("first length "+str(len(l)));
l[3] = 3;
print("resized length "+str(len(l)));
print("front "+str(next(l)));
print("back "+str(pop(l)));
print("eventual length "+str(len(l)));</code></pre>

<p>Running this creates the following output:</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
fist length 2
resized length 4 
front 0 
back 3 
eventual length 2
</pre>

<p>To effiently store and manipulate purely arithmetical data, 
blombly also offers a <code>vector</code> datatype. This holds floats
and provides efficient implementations for element-wise arithmetics.
The virtual machine can use unknown 
device resources (e.g., CPUs, GPUs) to perform operations as
efficiently as possible.
The currently implemented machine performs vector 
operations in CPUs with highly optimized C++ code.
<i>Future implementations will remain backwards-compatible, but
will also support multidimensional vectors with matrix multiplication.</i></p>

<p>Vectors differ from lists in that their number of elements cannot change.
That number is provided as an argument during their creation. Their
elements are then set to zeros and the <code>push</code>, <code>next</code>,
and <code>pop</code> operations are not provided. Similarly, setting 
an out-of-range value will create an error.
There are typecasts from lists to vectors, as demonstrated below. However, the inverse
conversion is not directly provided to avoid the code smell of converting 
a computationally efficient data structure with potentially many elements 
to a non-efficient one.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">
x = vector(5);  // zeros
x[2] = 1;
y = vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
print(x+y-1);</code></pre>
