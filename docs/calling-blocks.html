<h1>Calling blocks</h1>
<p>
    There are two mechanisms for creating callable code blocks (aka methods) in 
    Blombly. The first relies on directly calling defined blocks by passing 
    variables as keyword arguments. The second modifies block definitions so 
    that they accept positional arguments, or a mix of positional and keyword
    arguments.
    Calls to blocks other than builtin methods (or those overloading builtin methods
    in structs) run in parallel. Details of this orchestration are purposefully hidden 
    so that you can write code as if all calls were sequential instead. 
    In addition to their arguments, called blocks can access <i>final</i> values from the 
    scope of their declaration.
</p>
<h2>2.4.a Calling with keyword arguments</h2>
<p>
    Code blocks defined in Blombly can be called like methods by injecting 
    values as keyword arguments separated by semicolons. Actually, the
    arguments constitute a bracketless code block that runs in an interim
    new context whose assignments are transferred to the code call. When not 
    transforming data, it is recommended to stick to keywords for better 
    readability and maintainability per the principles of forward-oriented 
    programming that Blombly follows. For example, keyword arguments create a 
    sense of the functional role of each argument for those reading code.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>return</i> keyword ends block execution with the corresponding 
    returning value. That value is intercepted by the block call in the scope 
    of this section. However, the return signal may also be intercepted by the 
    <i>new</i> mechanism of the <a rel="prefetch" href="structs.html">next 
    section</a> and the <i>try</i> mechanism of <a rel="prefetch" 
    href="success-fail.html">section 2.6</a>. Beware that inlining such blocks 
    transfers their return statements to parent blocks too. There is only one
    returned value, but as always you can use commas between several values
    to create lists of returned values.
</p>
<p>
    The example below defines a simple block and calls it with 
    specific values for that inputs it needs to execute: The particular 
    declaration is made <i>final</i> for logic safety, but this does not 
    need to always be the case.
</p>
<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final add = {
    return x + y;
}

result = add(x=1;y=2);
print(result);
</code></pre>
<p>
    It was already mentioned that the space reserved for
    keyword arguments in block calls can in
    general be any other code block (without the brackets,
    as it requires fewer symbols to write and the range 
    is obvious from the call's parentheses). This means that
    you can also inline other blocks that serve as configuration
    for multiple calls. This pattern is demonstrated below, 
    alongside usage of the default keyword to set variables if 
    not already declared.
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>

<pre><code class="language-java">final add = {
    default scale = 1;
    return ((x/scale) + (y/scale))*scale;
}
config = {scale=2}
result = add(config:x=1;y=2);
print(result);
</code></pre>


<h2>2.4.b Calling with positional arguments</h2>
<p>
    Blombly also supports calling blocks using comma-separated positional 
    arguments. This is a common programming language pattern, and there are 
    two ways to enable it; both tackle how to retrieving positional values 
    from within called blocks. 
    The lower-level option is to make use of the <code>args</code> variable 
    generated by the compiler, which expressly holds positional arguments as a 
    list. For code safety, this is considered a language keyword and you are not
    allowed to assign to it.
    You can then access list elements or use <code>next</code> to obtain 
    their values (reminder that this pops the first list element, contrary to 
    pop that pops the last). An example of this coding pattern is shown below.
</p>
<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final add = {
    x = next(args);
    y = next(args);
    return x + y;
}

result = add(1, 2);
print(result);
</code></pre>
<p>
    A second and higher-level way of parsing positional arguments is to add their
    names inside a parenthesis next to the block's name, separated by commas. 
    This is a shorthand and still lets the block be be assigned to other variables 
    per normal. Blocks declared this way can be inlined directly within other called 
    blocks (because they must user ther scope's <i>args</i>). 
    The following example is equivalent to the previous one. Finally, the implicit
    <code>next</code> remove the first entries from the arguments, you can still 
    access the rest if more are provided in the call.
</p>
<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final add(x, y) = { 
    // shorthand for front-popping these values with next
    return x + y;
}
test = add; // can still transfer the definition this way

result = test(1, 2);
print(result);
</code></pre>

<h2>2.4.c Mixing the two types of arguments</h2>
<p>
    Blombly allows mixing of positional and "keyword" arguments in a single 
    call with a pattern that reads similarly to conditional probabilities 
    <code>name(args | kwargs)</code> where args are the positional arguments and 
    kwargs the bracketless code block that is used to generate the keyword 
    arguments. Positional arguments are generated first from the calling scope, 
    and can therefore modify the <code>args</code> if needed.
</p>
<p>
    In the following example, the block <code>add</code> is defined with two 
    parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and two default parameters, 
    <code>wx</code> and <code>wy</code>. When calling <code>add</code>, we pass 
    the numbers <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> as positional arguments, which 
    are internally matched to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Knowing the 
    details about default parameters is not necessary at the point where the 
    decision to use the block is made.
</p>
<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final add(x, y) = {
    default wx = 1;
    default wy = 1;
    return x*wx + y*wy;
}

result = add(1,2 | wx=1;wy=2);
print(result);
</code></pre>
