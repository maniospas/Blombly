There are many programming languages for writing dynamic yet safe code. You might already have a favorite one! However, safety often comes at the cost of reduced expressiveness, like mutability restrictions, or may rely on non-infallible programmers. Blombly addresses these issues with a small instruction set that is easy to learn and use but which promises code and memory safety. It also focuses on programming logic by automating details of how algorithms execute, like parallelization. 

Blombly compiles into an intermediate representation that is interpreted by the **BLO**ck ase**MBLY** **V**irtual **M**achine (blomblyVM). This replaces jump-based statements to calling code blocks and supports dynamic code inlining as a major language feature. Control flow is managed via conditions, loops, inlining, method calling, return statements for results, and errors on failure.

So, who is Blombly for? It might be a good choice if you are looking a language with these features:


## ðŸš€ Expressive

Focus on writing algorithms, and leave details like parallelization to the virtual machine. Enjoy comprehensive explanations and suggestions for syntax or runtime errors.

## ðŸ¦† Dynamic

Take advantage of features like duck typing, automatic garbage collection, and changing which code blocks are inlined. Use `try` to intercept algorithm results (errors and returns).

## ðŸ’» Safe

Write memory-safe code with atomic struct access and "one-best-way" to do things. Safety is imposed on edge cases by preventing ambiguity.

## ðŸ’¡Simple

All interfaces follow an "one solution" principle, meaning that there is usually only one obvious implementation. For example, there is only one loop structure (`while`) but other basic functionality lets it iterate over list elements or break prematurely.
