## ðŸš© Reusable

Blombly is _behaviorizeable_, which means that modular interfaces written in it have [learnable usage rules](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220821000778). This way, code has learnable usage patterns instead of promoting recipe copy-ing.

## ðŸš€ Expressive

Focus on writing algorithms. These are compiled into an intermediate representation that is interpreted by the **BLO**ck ase**MBLY** **V**irtual **M**achine (blomblyVM), which handles details like parallelization on its own.

## ðŸ¦† Dynamic

Take advantage of features like duck typing, automatic garbage collection, and changing which code blocks are inlined. Use `try` to intercept and handle algorithm results, namely errors and returns. Blombly also follows [typeless structs](material/typeless.md).

## ðŸ’¡Simple

Learn a few simple commands, with altenatives available only for drastic code simplification. For example, the same loop command (`while`) combines with others to iterate over list elements or ranges, or break prematurely.
