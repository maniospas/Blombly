<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>Let us create a first program to show a compilation and interpretation process.
Create the following example file, where the <i>.bb</i> extension is associated
with blombly source code. Careful to not forget the trailing 
semicolon, as this would create an error when trying to compile and execute the file. 
In general, there is enforcement of unambiguous
code syntax that prevents code smells and has a unique way of implementing every
functionality. Use a Java syntax highlighter (but not a syntax checker), as the
two languages share many keywords. </p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">print("Hello world!");</code></pre>


<p>To run this file, download the blombly
executable from the language's <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/BlomblyVM">GitHub</a> 
page and add it to the filepath. Then run the following console command:</p>

<pre class="code-output">
> blombly main.bb
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
Hello world!
</pre>

<p>Success! If a message that starts with 
<span class="code-output" style="font-size:0.7em;">(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>)</span>
appeared, the language was set up properly, but there was some syntax or logic error:
there may be a missing file or semicolon, usage of the wrong type of brackets, or some other
infraction. In this case, read the error's details carefully, as they are curated to be highly 
descriptive. More information on errors is provided in the <a rel="prefetch" href="errors.html">next 
section</a>. If another type of console error message appeared, please make sure that the blombly 
executable is compatible with your operating system and properly added in the file path.
</p>
    
<p>Compilation creates an abstract syntax tree and converts it into the blomlyVM 
intermediate representation language, shown below, which can also run directly.
BlomblyVM files always have the <i>.bbvm</i> extension and look like assembly code.
Temporary variables starting with <i>_bb</i> are also created. Often, compilation also optimizes
the code to take advantage of language features like caching memory locations for result
outcomes and declaring temporary code blocks as final to avoid redefinition during loops.
As a final remark, blomblyVM files pack all necessary dependencies internally, and can
therefore be shared for direct execution. </p>

<i>main.bbvm</i>
<pre><code class="language-bbvm">BUILTIN _bb0 "Hello world!"
print # _bb0    
</code></pre>

<p>The script <i>bbreader.py</i> (written in Python) converts compiled code to the main language
for easier reading, although without removing the compilation's intemediate variables.</p>
