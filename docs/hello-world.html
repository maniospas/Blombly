<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>Let's make a first program to demonstrate the compilation and interpretation process.
Create the following example file, where the <i>.bb</i> extension is associated
with blombly source code. Do not forget the trailing semicolon, as error messages
are created for wrong syntax or code smells that would be hard to debug. Use a Java 
syntax highlighter (but not a syntax checker), as the two languages share many keywords. </p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">print("Hello world!");</code></pre>

<p>To run this file, download the blombly
executable from the language's <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/BlomblyVM">GitHub</a> 
page and add it to the filepath. Then run the following console command:</p>

<pre class="code-output">
> blombly main.bb
Hello world!
</pre>

<p>Success! If a message that starts with 
<span class="code-output" style="font-size:0.7em;">(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>)</span>
appears, the language was set up properly but there was some syntax or logic error.
For example, brackets may have closed with a semicolon, or there could be some other type of
infraction. Read the error details carefully, as they are curated to be highly 
descriptive. More information on errors is provided in the <a rel="prefetch" href="errors.html">next 
section</a>. If another type of console error message appears, make sure that the blombly 
executable is compatible with your operating system and properly added to the file path.
</p>
    
<p>Compilation creates an abstract syntax tree and converts it into the blomlyVM 
intermediate representation language, like the one shown below.
BlomblyVM files are associated with the <i>.bbvm</i> extension and look like assembly code.
They pack any dependencies internally and be run directly; thus they can be shared directly
for execution by others. Concerning their contents, 
temporary variables starting with <i>_bb</i> are created. Compilation also optimizes
the code to take advantage of virtual machine features like cached memory locations 
and declaring temporary code blocks as final to avoid redefinition during loops. </p>

<i>main.bbvm</i>
<pre><code class="language-bbvm">BUILTIN _bb0 "Hello world!"
print # _bb0    
</code></pre>
