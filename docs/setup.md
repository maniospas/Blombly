# Setup

## Hello world!

Let's make a first program to demonstrate the compilation and interpretation process. Create the following example file, where the `.bb` extension is associated with Blombly source code. 
Use a Java syntax highlighter (but not a syntax checker), as the two languages share many keywords.


```java
// main.bb
print("Hello world!");
```

To run this file, download Blombly's latest [release](https://github.com/maniospas/Blombly/releases/latest). Extract that into a folder
and add the latter to your filepath to let your operating system know where `blombly.exe` is located. Alternatively,
use the full path to the executable everywhere. Instructions to build the library from source are in the
[GitHub](https://github.com/maniospas/Blombly) page.


Once you set things up, run the following console command. 
If a message starting with `( ERROR )` appears, everything runs properly but there was some syntax or logic issue.
For example, brackets may have closed with a semicolon, or there could be some other type of infraction. More on errors below.

```bash
> blombly main.bb
Hello world!
```



## VM code

Compilation converts code to a BlomlyVM intermediate representation. 
This looks like assembly code and is stored win files with the `.bbvm` extension. 
These are self-contained by packing all dependencies inside, and so can be shared with others and run directly.
The following file is generated when you run`main.bb` above.

```asm
% blombly.bbvm
BUILTIN _bb0 "Hello world!"
print # _bb0
```

```bash
> blombly main.bbvm
Hello world!
```

 To get a sense for internal commands, each one is a tuple of virtual machine instruction and its arguments
 are separated by spaces. The first argument is always a variable to assign to, where `#` indicates
 assignment to nothing. Temporary variables start with `_bb`, 
 and code blocks start by `BEGIN` or `BEGINFINAL` and end at `END`.

 Compilation optimizes the code for faster execution,
 for example by removing unused variables.
 To convert back the compilation outcome to semi-readable Blombly,
 run the Python script `bbreader.py` (this is intensionally written in a different language
 to also help with development debugging).


## Errors

Before jumping into actual coding, let us peek at errors that Blombly may create. There are two types:

- Syntax errors are identified by the compiler and make it halt.
- Logical errors occur at runtime and can be intercepted and handled with `try` and `catch` respectively. 

To see what a syntax error looks like, execute the following invalid code.
We get an error telling us that the + operation for string concatenation has no right-hand side. 
The compiler shows the exact position of the missing expression within the source code.

```java
// main.bb
print("Hello"+);  // CREATES AN ERROR
```

```bash
> blombly main.bb
 (<ERROR>) Empty expression
   â†’ std::print("Hello"+);  main.bb line 1
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
```

Look at a logical error looks like by printing a variable that does not exist.
This creates an error during runtime that points to the stack trace of compiled code and the original source. 
You will see full traces, regardless of which computations are internally delegated to threads.
Such errors can be handled are runtime, but this is a more advanced concept that we talk about [later](success-fail.md).


```java
// main.bb
print(x);  // CREATES AN ERROR
```
