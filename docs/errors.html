<h1>Errors</h1>

<p>Before moving on, let us take a peek at errors that blombly may create. Broadly, there
are syntax errors, which are identified by the compiler and make it halt, and logical
errors that occur at runtime and can be caught with appropriate try clauses (see later).
To see what a syntax error looks like, let us try to execute the following invalid code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">print("Hello"+);  // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>

<p>We get the following error, from which we can see that the <code>+</code> operation for
string concatenation (see later) is added with no right-hand side. Notice that the compiler
shows the full deconstruction process into an abstract syntax tree, to help understand what
it's doing.</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>) Empty expression
  <span class="arrow">→</span>                                             main.bb line 1
  <span class="arrow">→</span> "Hello" +                                   main.bb line 1
  <span class="arrow">→</span> ( "Hello" + )                               main.bb line 1
  <span class="arrow">→</span> print ( "Hello" + )                         main.bb line 1
  <span class="arrow">→</span> print ( "Hello" + ) ;                       main.bb line 1
</pre>

<p>Let us see what a logical error looks like too. Try to print a variable that does not
exist in the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">print(x);  // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>

<p>This creates the following error during runtime. It points to the stack trace of both
compiled code and the original source. If the source file is missing, you will still get
to see where the error's lines, for example to make sense of stack traces reported by
others.</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>) Missing value: x
  <span class="arrow">→</span> print # x                                   main.bbvm line 1
</pre>

<p>If the error was more complicated, the virtual machine would show the full stack trace
leading to the failure. Errors maintain a full stack trace even if segments of the code
run in threads.</p>

<p>:bulb: There are metadata properties that can obfuscate code and error tracking.</p>
