# Introduction

This section covers Blombly commands that are used in writing sequential code. It includes concepts 
that may already be familiar, such as comments, variable handling, builtin datatypes, and flow control. 
But more features are added to the mix, like immutable variables and trying until return.

## Comments

Blombly only has line comments that start with `//`. However, it supports multi-line strings and these can be used for 
documention as in the snippet below. Do not worry about bloating the size of intermediate representation files, as the
compiler optimizes away unused code segments that cannot produce side-effects.

```java
// main.bb
"This is multiline documentation 
that describes the current file.";
print("Hello world!"); // This is a line comment.
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Hello world!
</pre>


## Builtins

Assign values to variables with the equality operator (`=`), like below. If a variable with the same name already exists in the current scope, its value is overwritten. 
Otherwise, a new variable is created. Subsequent code in the same scope will retrieve that assigned value when using the variable. Scopes refer to isolated execution contexts 
in which subsequent code can overwrite variable values. Each program starts from one initial scope, but new ones are created when creating new objects or calling methods.

There are several builtin data types that are directly incorporated in the language.
Exhaustively, these are `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `list`, `vector`, `map`, `iter`, `code`, `struct`, `file`, `server`.
Here we start with the first four, and split the rest to dedicated pages, like the one describing [iterables](iterables.md).

```java
// main.bb
i = 1;     // int 
f = 1.2;   // float 
b = false; // bool (or true)
s = "this is a string";
```

Some well-known operations on the above types are listed below. These are computed as one might have come to learn from other programming
languages. Only difference to usual practices is that the `not` operation has higher priority than assignment.

| Category                 | Operations                              | Description                                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Assignment               | `(expression)`                         | Compute the expression first. Also used in method calls later. |
| Assignment               | `y=x`, `y as x`                        | The return values of assignments are covered below. |
| Conversion               | `typename(x)`                          | Everything can be converted to `str`, numbers can be converted from `str`. |
| Elements                 | `a[i]`, `a[i]=x`                       | Element get and set for strings. |
| Arithmetics              | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` <br> `^` <br> `%`   | Basic arithmetics (division is floating-point). <br> Exponentiation. <br> Modulo for integers. |
| String operations        | `+`                                    | Concatenation.                                                                      |
| Comparisons              | `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` <br>  `==`, `!=`  | Inequality comparisons. <br> Equality comparisons.                   |
| Boolean operations       | `and`, `or` <br> `not`                 | Logical operations for booleans.  <br> Negation of any boolean value it prepends.   |



Here is an example that contains some of these operations:

```java
// main.bb
x = int("1");
y = float("0.5");
print("Sum is " + str(x+y)); // there is no implicit typecasting
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Sum is 1.500000
</pre>


## String formatting

Blombly supports string literals; expressions enclosed in brackets
are replaced with their evaluation and converted to `str`. For safety,
expression terminating symbols (like brackets, inlining colons, or semicolons) 
are not allowed within literals during parsing. However, you may still have 
simple control flow as long as you avoid such symbols.
With string literals, the previous paragraph's example may be rewritten as `"Sum is {x+y}"`.

Format numbers using providing a string specification in the element access notation. It
returns a string and

```java
//main.bb
x = 1.3456;
print("Here is a number: " + x[".3f"]);
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Here is a number: 1.346
</pre>

Formatting numbers within literals is discussed alongside advanced typecasting [here](../advanced/semitypes.md).
For now, we provide a first taste that the recommended syntax looks like below. Briefly, a callable formatter is defined
and then applied within the literal with typecast notation `x | fmt`, which is equivalent to `fmt(x)`.

```java
fmt(x) = {return x[".3f"]}
x = 1;
print("This is a number {x | fmt}");  
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Here is a number: 1.346
</pre>


## Final variables

Variable values are made immutable by prepending the `final` keyword to their assignment. This prevents subsequent code from overwriting values
and exposes them to code running outside the current scope. For the time being, however, consider final as a code safety feature.
Here is an example of the error shown when attempting to overwrite a final value.

```java
// main.bb
final x = 0; 
x = x+1; // CREATES AN ERROR
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
<span style="color: cyan;">> ./blombly</span> main.bb --strip
 (<span style="color: red;">ERROR</span>) Cannot overwrite final value: x
    <span style="color: lightblue;">â†’</span>  add x x _bb2                                      main.bbvm line 4
</pre>


## Control flow

Control flow alters which code segments are executed next. Blombly offers similar options to most programming languages in terms of conditional branching, loops, deffering
execution for later, method calling,
and error handling. The first three of those are described here, whereas method calling is described [seperately](blocks.md) because it offers more options than other languages. 
Error handling also has its own dedicated page [here](../advanced/signals.md), though below give a first taste of the `try` keyword's dynamic usage in other cases.

Conditionals take the form `if(@condition){@accept}else{@reject}` where `@` denotes code segments (by the way, this is the macro declaration notation). 
The condition must yield a boolean and makes the respective branch execute, where the `else` branch is optional.
You may ommit brackets for single-command segments, but put semicolons only at the end of commands.

```java
// main.bb
x = 1;
if (x>0) print("positive")  // no semicolon (because the command would end)
else if(x<0) print("negative");
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
positive
</pre>

Similarly, loops take the form `while (condition) {@code}` and keep executing the code while the condition is `true`. 
To avoid ambiguity, there are no other ways in the language's core to declare a loop, albeit the `in` keywords allows
you to iterate through lists and the like. Again, you may ommit brackets if only one command runs.
Here is an example:

```java
// main.bb
counter = 0;
while (counter<5) {
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Counter is 0
Counter is 1
Counter is 2
Counter is 3
Counter is 4
</pre>

Finally, deferring is a command that declares code but makes it run later. *The deferred code always runs*, even
if errors occur in the interim. Normally, it is executed just before return statements, including returning from
`new` statements creating structs.
In advanced settings, you can remove cyclic struct references. Here is a usage of defer where we ignore the brackers
of the deferred code block.

```java
// main.bb
A = new { // this is how structs are created
    x=0;
    defer x=1; // executed just before the end of struct creation
    print(x);
}
print(A.x);
```


<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
0
1
</pre>

## Errors as values

Computations like converting invalid strings to numbers may 
generate errors, or using the `next` operator of iterators,
return errors as values. These do not immediately stop execution
but only halt control flow if they are overwritten,
used in subsequent computations, or not handled.

One way of handling errors -aside from the catch statement that will not be covered here- is
via the `as` keyword. This performs an assignment without breaking normal code writting 
on encountering an error value, but by returning a true/false value depending on whether
an error was found. For example, below is a simple one-liner that retries
reading from the console until a number if provided. It also
use function-based typecasting (where `@str|@func` is equivalent to `@func(@str)`) to chain
function calls.

```java
while(not number as "Give a number:"|read|float) {}
print(number);
```


<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Give a number: number
Give a number: 12
12
</pre>


## Try until return

Here we make a soft introduction to return signals; if errors indicate
unsuccessful algorithms, return statements indicate successful conclusion of
computations. This introduction focuses on the returning part (not on error handling), as
this supports what other languages dub as continue and break statements 
without needing such keywords.

To intercept return or error signals, use the `value = try{@code}` pattern. 
This is the same mechanism as the one we [next](blocks.md) use to
return values from called methods and unwind error stack traces.
By ommiting brackets when only one command is tried, we can conveniently
combine the interception mechanism with other control flows like so:

```java
// main.bb
x = "Give a number: "|read|float;
sgn = try if(x>=0) return 1 else return -1;
print("Sign is {sgn}");
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Give a number: 42
Sign is 1
</pre>


A similar syntax breaks away from loops below, though we will not dabble on 
handling returned values for now. Contrary to error handling overheads, 
it is lightweight to intercept returns.

```java
// main.bb
counter = 0;
try while (true) {
    counter = counter + 1;
    print("Counter is: " + str(counter));
    if(counter==5) return;  // keeps exiting the code until intercepted by try
}
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Counter is 1
Counter is 2
Counter is 3
Counter is 4
Counter is 5
</pre>

Similarly, prepend `try` to loop bodies to let internal returns skip the rest of the body. 
All covered syntax allows at most one irregular exit point from control flows,
which makes code simpler.

```java
// main.bb
counter = 0;
while (counter<5) try {
    counter = counter + 1;
    if (counter % 2==0) return;
    print("Odd value: " + str(counter));
}
```

<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Odd value: 1
Odd value: 3
Odd value: 5
</pre>

As a simpler example, use `try` to create switch statements, like below:

```java
// main.bb
value = "Give a number: "|read|float;
test = try {
    if(value>1) return "large";
    if(value<-1) return "small";
    return "in unit interval";
}
print("Number is {test}");
```


<pre style="font-size: 80%;background-color: #333; color: #AAA; padding: 10px 20px;">
> <span style="color: cyan;">./blombly</span> main.bb
Give a number: -100
Number is small
</pre>
