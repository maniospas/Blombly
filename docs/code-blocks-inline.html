<h1>Code blocks & inline</h1>

<p>The main logic compartmentalization mechanism in blombly are code blocks; these are flexible
coding segments that can be treated as methods, used to define various control flows, or called 
inline. Code blocks are declared by enclosing them in brackets and assigning them to a
variable, like below. Notice that there is no trailing semicolon after the brackets, and the compile
will create an error for you if you try to add one per the principle of having unique consise
syntax. The declaration can also be <i>final</i> to make sure that the same variable always
points to the particular block in the current scope.</p> 

<p>The declaration itself does not do anything more than setting a variable. 
But you can effectively "paste" a block's
internal code to the current position like below, where the expression ends with double colon 
<code>:</code> instead of a semicolon to significy this behavior. This is called <i>inline execution</i>
and has full access to variables in the current scope (both for usage and modification). The
main usage pattern of inline execution is when you want to enrich your current code with a snippet
defined elsewhere, which creates minimal overhead compared to creating a stack.
You may even change which snippet to inline.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">test = {
  print("Hello world");
}
test:</code></pre>

<p>We tackle usage of code blocks as methods in the 
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">next section</a>. For now, let 
us continue with block declaration options by showing how to also declare 
and retrieve some metadata for them. To this end, blombly offers the dot 
<code>.</code> notation like structs/objects in most languages. Metadata are
different than struct fields in that their main purpose is declaring
immutable properties like documentation and source code version; blombly 
handles structs with different mechanisms described in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="structs.html">section 2.5</a>.
As metadata are immutable values conceptually, assigning a value to them includes 
the <code>final</code> keyword. For safety, an error will occur otherwise. 
Here is an example of proper usage:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final test = { // ensure that this does not change in current scope
  print("Hello world! I am a running code block.");
}
final test.version = 1.0;  // setting metadata is always final
final test.license = "CC0";

print("Running test version "+str(test.version)
     +" under "+test.license+" license...");

test: // block code directly runs here</code></pre>



<p>A shorthand for declaring metatadata constists of defining them at
the beginning of blocks while replacing <i>this.</i> with the 
<code>#</code> symbol. This declaration can not use any of the block's 
variables, but it can use variables from the block's declaring scope, 
as it is interpreted equivalently to above. That is, the metadata sets 
are performed in the declaring scope just after the block declaration
finishes. Importantly, the same notation lets us treat source
code files as blocks that also have metadata. You might want 
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">#doc = "This is a documented file.";

final test = {
  #version = 1.0;
  #license = "CC0";
  print("Hello world! I am a running code block.");
}</code></pre>

As a coding standard, we encourage the usage of the following metadata
fields: version = float, license = str, author=str, doc = str.
