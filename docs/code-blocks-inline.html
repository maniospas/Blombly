<h1>Code blocks & inline</h1>

<p>The main logic compartmentalization mechanism in blombly are code blocks; these are flexible
coding segments that can be treated as methods, used to define various control flows, or called 
inline. Code blocks are declared by enclosing them in brackets and assigning them to a
variable, like below. Notice that there is no trailing semicolon, and the compiler
will create an error if you do try to add one, under the principle of "one solution". 
The declaration can also be <code>final</code> to make sure that the same variable always
points to the particular block in the current scope, and that method calls starting from
the scope have access to it.</p> 

<p>The declaration itself only sets a variable. But you can effectively "paste" a block's
internal code to the current position by using the block's name followed by double dots
<code>:</code>.  This is called inline execution and demonstrated below.
Inlining has full access to variables in the current scope (both for usage and modification). 
The main usage pattern to enrich your current code with a snippet
defined elsewhere, which may also change dynamically.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">test = {
  print("Hello world");
}
test:</code></pre>

<p>We tackle usage of code blocks as methods in the 
<a rel="prefetch" href="calling-blocks.html">next section</a>. For now, 
let us see how to declare and retrieve some specification for them. 
In the simplest case, blombly offers the dot 
<code>.</code> notation, like the language's structs described in
<a rel="prefetch" href="structs.html">section 2.5</a> to read and write specification
data. The latter differ from struct fields in that they declare
immutable properties, like documentation and source code versions.
When assigning specifications without evoking a preprocessor directive, use the
the <code>final</code> keyword to signify their immutable nature. 
For logic safety, an error will occur otherwise. 
Here is an example usage:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final test = { // ensure that this does not change in current scope
  print("Hello world! I am a running code block.");
}
final test.version = 1.0;  // setting metadata is always final
final test.license = "CC0";

print("Running test version "+str(test.version)
     +" under "+test.license+" license...");

test: // block code directly runs here</code></pre>



<p>A shorthand for declaring specifications constists of defining them at
the beginning of blocks using the <code>#spec</code> directive 
for the preprocessor. This declaration can not use any of the block's 
variables, but uses the variables from the block's declaring scope, 
as it is interpreted equivalently to above. That is, the metadata sets 
are performed in the declaring scope just after the block declaration
finishes. Importantly, the same notation lets us treat source
code files as blocks that also have metadata. You might want 
</p>

<p>As a coding standard, usage of the following metadata
fields is encouraged: </p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">#spec doc = "This is a documented program.";
#spec author = "Emmanouil Krasanakis (maniospas@hotmail.com)";
#spec version = 1.0;

final example = {
  #spec doc = "This is a documented code block";
  print("Hello world! I am a documented method.");
}</code></pre>
