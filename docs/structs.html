<h1>Structs</h1>

<p>This section describes the process with which to make structs, that is, objects
that hold certain variables that can be accessed and set with the dot notation. 
Similarly to scopes, structs can have final variables.
There are three mechanisms to keep in mind: a) usage of the <code>new</code> keyword
to create a scope for declaring structs (all scope assignments are transferred to
the produced stuct), b) the <code>this</code> keyword from which struct members
can be accessed from called code blocks, and c) private variables that are not
exposed externally. In addition to these concepts, we also demonstrate usage of
code blocks as constructors to be inlined within struct creation. Builerplate
best practices to support object-oriented programming are provided as macros
in the <code>"std/oop"</code> include covered in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="preprocessor.html">section 3.1</a>. For the time
being, though, we stick to base language features.</p>

<h2>2.5.a New</h2>

<p>You can create a data structure (aka object) with the <code>new {@code}</code> syntax.
This creates a new scope that sees its parent's variables but keeps track of all new assignments.
A struct holding those assignments as fields is returned, unless another return statement
interrupts this (more on this in <a rel="prefetch" href="return-from-new.html">section 3.3</a>). 
Struct fields can be accessed with the dot <code>.</code> operator afterwards, as shown below:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">zbias = 0;
y = 2;
point = new {
  x = 1;
  y = y; // get y from the parent scope because it is not set locally, then set it locally
  z = x+y+zbias; // x and y from local scope, zbias from the parent scope 
}
point.x = 4;
print(point.x);
print(point.y);
print(point.z);
print(point.zbias); // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>

<p>Running the above code yields the following output. An error is created because
<code>new</code> only retains the assignments inside; the resulting struct is detached
from the creator scope and cannot "see" the variable <code>zbias</code>.</p>

<pre class="code-output">
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Compilation
(<span class="ok"> OK </span>) Optimization
4 
2
3
(<span class="error"> ERROR </span>) Missing value: zbias
  <span class="arrow">→</span> get _bb12 point zbias                       main.bbvm line 20  
</pre>

<p>Blocks declared within <code>new</code> have access to an immutable (<code>final</code>)
variable called <code>this</code> that holds the struct. Access to this as a means of setting
and writting fields is possible only after the struct's creation concludes. Furthermore, unless 
exposed through a different mechanism, the compiler prevents usage of <code>@obj.this</code>.
For example, next is a definition of a code block that is to be used as a method. Typically,
it is adviseable.</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">point = new {
  sum2d = {return this.x+this.y;}
  sum3d = {return this.sum2d()+this.z;}
  x = 1;
  y = 2;
  z = 3;
}
print(point.sum3d());</code></pre>

<p>Normal variable visibility rules apply; to let a struct's code blocks call each
other, either make them <code>final</code> or access them from <code>this</code> as
above. For consiseness and portability (inling in non-struct methods), 
the first option is preferred. Boilerprate that
applies best practices for object-oriented programming
is provided by <code>std/oop</code>import in the form of
macros (basically syntax enrichments). Related material can be found in 
<a rel="prefetch" href="preprocessor.html">section 3.1</a>.</p>

<h2>2.5.b Inlined code blocks as constuctors</h2>

<p>In blombly, inlining can be used to treat code blocks as part of constructors. This is
a generalization of multi-inheritance that allows any number of blocks to work together
during struct definitions. Inline the declaration of
member functions as in the following example:</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">final Point = {
  norm = {return (this.x^2+this.y^2)^0.5;} 
}
final XYSetter = {
  setx(value) = {this.x = value;}
  sety(value) = {this.y = value;}
}
point = new {
  Point:
  XYSetter:
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
}
point.sety(4);

print(point.norm());</code></pre>

<p>To prevent code smells and maintain the principle of "one solution", 
the compiler does not accept the notation
<code>new @block</code> where <code>@block</code> is a code block. Instead, inline that block
per <code>new {@block:}</code>. Similarly, final members cannot be set (e.g., with ).
That is, any declaration that is not made final during a struct definition can not be
made final in the future. This imposes a clear distinction between mutable and immutable
properties.</p>


<h2>2.5.c Private variables</h2>

<p>It is often important to declare local variables that may not be
directly exposed outside their enclosing structs. This promotes code safety
in the form of hidden states that cannot be altered externally.
a such private variables is done by prepending their name
with the slash <code>\</code>. Private variables can be accessed only
if declared or if their name (including the slash) follows the 
<code>this</code> keyword specifically, in which case they are retrieved
from the namesake object. These private access restrictions are enforced 
by the compiler but not during interpretation (so <code>.bbvm</code>
files can circumvent code safety).
</p>

<i>main.bb</i>
<pre><code class="language-java">point = new {
  \x = 0;
  \y = 0;
  set = {
    if(x as x) // effectively checks if 
      this\x = x;
    if(y as y)
      this\y = y;
  }
  add = {return this\x + this\y}
}

point.set(x=1);
print(point.add());
print(point\x); // CREATES AN ERROR</code></pre>
