# Contribution Guidelines

Everyone is welcome to:

- Report Blombly bugs or -at this stage- behavior that you think is unexpected. Do so in GitHub issues.
- I am also open to opinions about language design. Also open an issue for this.
- Create pull requests for improving the documentation in `docs/`.
- Create pull requests for more testing in `tests/`.
- Create pull requests for more core library features in `libs/`.


I am currently *not* open to practices that are well meaning but carry the risk of injecting code 
that is unprotected by the language's built-in safety features. This would require QA from my part
that I presently do not have the time to perform. Mainly:

- Do not open requests with non-trivial source code changes. Please get in touch with me first at maniospas@hotmail.com if you are interested in contributing to the code base.
